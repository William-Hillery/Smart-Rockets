# Process
### Genetic Algorithim for controling 'rockets', and moving them to a target
The rockets are moved with a set of Instruction for what to do on each frame of life.  These are stored, and it says whether or not to turn left or right and how much, an they steer.  These instructions slowly evolve and mutate over time.
# Download
Click the green `Clone or download` button above the files, then click `Download ZIP` and, when it downloads, move it to Desktop and open it.  go into the folder and double-click `index.html`.
# Use
The vehicles will evolve to reach the target on their own, but you can add obstacles.  simply click once to make one corner, move, and click again to make a rectangle.  if you hold the `-` key, no box will be drawn, and, if you click an obstacle while holding `-`, it will be removed.
